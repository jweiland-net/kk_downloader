I can´t insert categories in a new partner record
-------------------------------------------------

You have to put your SysFolder into the “ General Record Storage page” resp. “starting point” of your page.
Sometimes it is better to create a general storage page (sysfolder) for the categories and then put this one
into the above mentioned field of the sysfolder that takes the download files in.

When I upload a file I got the message that the filesize should be too large?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upload file size is limited by a variable in the base configuration.
